# tkoz-all-v1

An experiment to try to put "all" my code in one setup (C, C++, Python, and probably more). Inspired by the mono repo setup in my workplace.

# todo

- ctest for unit testing
- gcov/llvm-cov code coverage
- clang-tidy and cppcheck
- documentation with doxygen
- deduplicate scripts (take build type as arg, do not multiply scripts by 4)
