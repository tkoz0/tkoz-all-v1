# contributions

Since this repo is mainly intended as a personal playground, please do not try
to make large contributions without contacting me first. I am interested in
working on projects with others, but that should be in another serious repo
rather than my personal playground.

Things may change rapidly as I work out ideas and perfect interfaces. That is
the intent of the mono repo setup, to give some freedom and flexibility for
things to change as much as I want. When a project reaches a higher level of
maturity, it may get its own repo somewhere. If people express greater interest
in contributing to a project, it may expand to its own repo as well.
