# srtest

Statically registered tests. This is intended to be a library for unit testing
which works by defining functions which are statically registered to the test
runner. The tests are defined in the library source files and automatically
handled by a test runner which links the library.

###### name choice

The tests are statically registered by linking libraries. So the name came from
statically registered tests (SRT). But I decided to call it SRTest to make it
more clear that it is a testing library. The acronym was of interest because
one of my favorite Blue Archive characters, Miyako Tsukiyuki, is from the school
SRT Special Academy.
